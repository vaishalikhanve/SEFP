problem:1.Unsecure transfere of funds(any one in between can take away donation).
        2.People don't know what to donate and where to donate(location).
        3.People may give their donation to unsecured organization .

Solutions:
      1.LIst of requirements from victims with their exact location and contact info ,so that single person or some group of person can send 
      via transportation agency.
      2.List of trusted organisation (actually working for victims)
      3.People can not only donate funds but can donate spare goods in their home(utensil,food,clothes,buckets etc) .

Future work:
    1.Will be including organization to take care of transfer goods from helpers to victims.
    2.Let helpers know if their help reached safely.
    3.will be keeping record of helpers also .
    4.will be providing communication interface between victims ,organization and helper(like text messaging through this app).
